Dynamic Grid Repository

This repository accompanies the paper: S. Willemsen, S. Bilbao, M. Ducceschi, and S. Serafin, "The Dynamic Grid: Time-Varying Parameters for Musical Instrument Simulations based on Finite-Difference Time-Domain Schemes," submitted to J. Audio Eng. Soc. (JAES), 2021. 

- dynamicStiffString.m is an implementation of the dynamic grid applied to an implementation of the damped stiff string.

- SoundExamples is a folder containing several sounds created using the dynamic stiff string implementation as well as the dynamic thin plate.
